# ML Learning Journey üöÄ

This repository contains my machine learning learning journey and will be continuously updated as I learn and implement new concepts.

## üìö Learning Topics Covered

### üîß Data Preprocessing

#### Feature Scaling & Normalization
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning that transforms raw data into a format suitable for ML algorithms. Feature scaling ensures all features contribute equally to the model by bringing them to similar scales.

- [**Numerical Data Preprocessing**](numerical_ds_preprocessing.ipynb) - StandardScaler and train-test split
  - **Theory**: StandardScaler transforms features to have mean=0 and std=1, essential for algorithms sensitive to feature scales
  - **Use Cases**: SVM, Neural Networks, PCA, KMeans clustering
  
- [**Data Standardization & Train-Test Split**](d_standaize_train_test_split.ipynb) - Feature scaling and data splitting
  - **Theory**: Proper train-test splitting prevents data leakage and ensures unbiased model evaluation
  - **Best Practices**: 80-20 or 70-30 splits, stratified sampling for classification

#### Categorical Data Processing  
Categorical variables need special handling since ML algorithms work with numerical data. Different encoding methods have different implications for model performance.

- [**Label Encoding**](label_encoding.ipynb) - Converting categorical data to numerical
  - **Theory**: Maps categories to integers, preserves ordinal relationships but may introduce artificial ordering
  - **When to Use**: Ordinal data, tree-based algorithms
  - **Alternatives**: One-hot encoding for nominal data, target encoding for high cardinality

#### Missing Data Handling
Missing data is common in real-world datasets and requires careful treatment to avoid biased or unreliable models.

- [**Handle Missing Values**](handle_missing_values.ipynb) - Techniques for dealing with missing data
  - **Theory**: Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
  - **Techniques**: Deletion (listwise/pairwise), Imputation (mean/median/mode), Advanced methods (KNN, iterative)
  - **Impact**: Different methods affect model performance and interpretability differently

#### Class Imbalance Solutions
Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models that perform poorly on minority classes, especially in classification problems.

- [**Handle Imbalanced Data**](handle_imbalanced_dp.ipynb) - Methods for handling imbalanced datasets
  - **Theory**: Accuracy paradox, precision-recall tradeoff, cost-sensitive learning
  - **Techniques**: Oversampling (SMOTE), Undersampling, Class weights, Ensemble methods
  - **Evaluation**: F1-score, AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall curves instead of accuracy

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Text data requires specialized preprocessing to extract meaningful features that ML algorithms can understand.

- [**Text Data Preprocessing**](text_ds_preprocessing.ipynb) - Text cleaning and feature extraction
  - **Theory**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, TF-IDF, Bag of Words
  - **Challenges**: Noise removal, handling different languages, maintaining semantic meaning
  
- [**Text Data Preprocessing 2**](text_ds_preprocessing2.ipynb) - Advanced text processing techniques
  - **Theory**: N-grams, Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - **Modern Approaches**: BERT embeddings, transformer-based preprocessing
